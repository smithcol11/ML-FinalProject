# Machine Learning Group Final Project

### Description

This is a final project for Machine Learning at Portland State University.

In this project, we hope to compare the efficacies of SVM vs CNN methods for image classification. We will attempt to find the simplest kernel function and simplest convolutional net that give us the highest accuracy results, while avoiding overfitting. We will compare and contrast the two models and discuss the differences between them.
